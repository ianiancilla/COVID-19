<b>Marzia Faustinelli - COVID-19 visualisation project</b><br>
This is a fork of the amazing data gathered and published each day by <b>Johns Hopkins CSSE</b>, which can be found here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

The only thing I added is the <b>visualisation</b> folder, where I added a script which will analyse current data and visualise it.
<br>
* <b>Necessary libraries</b>: needs <b>plotly</b> to run.<br>
* <b>Output</b>: when running the script, html files will be created in the output folder, depending on what is activated in the script.py file. Available visualisations are:<br>
** a scattergeo representing number of active cases and death rate
** choropleth maps representing either active cases, or total death rate<br>
